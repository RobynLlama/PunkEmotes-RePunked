# PunkEmotes Re-Punked Edition

PunkEmotes by [Punkalyn](https://github.com/Punkalyn/PunkEmotes) is a mod that allows you to use animations from all the ATLYSS races.

## Usage

You can use the command `/em help` for the in-game help message, for explanation but here's a quick overview:

Use `/em {animation} {race}` in the in-game chatbox to use an emote. Replace {animation} with "sit" or "dance", and {race} can be "chang", "byrdle", "imp", "poon", and "kubold". The command `/em chang_sitinit02` is used for the chang /sit2 animation.
